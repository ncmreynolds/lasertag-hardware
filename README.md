# lasertag-hardware
This repository is a collection of files to help people with Lasertag hardware builds based off my and others' work. There are simple diagrams, STLs for printing, binaries for flashing directly onto microcontrollers etc. that avoid the need to configure and compile software etc.

This includes the following Lasertag related builds...

- [Matrix target](matrix-target/) - a dot-matrix test/practice target for WoW, UKLTA DoT and MilesTag/LaserWar
- [XLoader](xloader/) - a standalone uploader (Windows) for binary files to classic AVR microcontrollers. This is seemingly abandonware and is in this repository as a convenience given many online searches show up dubious malware
